## My process

I tried to stick to flexbox for most of this page, which worked out quite well, and divided the responsiveness of the site into three categories (320px or less, 320px to 600px, and everything above that).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I'm more comfortable with Flexbox after this project as well as media queries regarding screen size. I probably did this inverted from most people (using max width instead of min width to divide styling by screen size) but I think it works all the same for me in the end. I also figured out the proper cascading order for media queries.

Over all I again didn't spend a ton of time on this, but I"m happy with the result.
